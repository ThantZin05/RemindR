 RemindR - Requirements for full functionality

 1. Zenity - used for desktop popups
 2. Paplay - used for alarm sounds

 Notes:
 - If Zenity or Paplay are not installed, RemindR will still run in the terminal,
   but popups and alarms will not appear.
 - No other external dependencies are required.
