# RemindR 📌  
### A Daily Accountability System — Not Just a Reminder App

RemindR is a lightweight Rust-based automation tool designed to enforce daily commitment, increase deadline awareness, and track behavioral consistency.

It does not simply notify you.

It asks:
- Did you complete the task?
- If not, why?

That difference builds accountability.

## 🚀 Why RemindR?

Most reminder apps allow you to ignore notifications.

RemindR requires confirmation.

If a task is not completed, the system prompts you to enter a reason.  
That reason is recorded in your daily report — creating reflection and long-term behavioral insight.

This transforms missed tasks into learning opportunities.
